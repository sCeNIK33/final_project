<p>This is our team code for the <b>final project</b>. We selected <i>Project #12</i>. This project involves building an ice-breaker question generator to help people get past small-talk during Zoom calls. Users will be able to log in, browse our questions (that are stored), and save the ones they like best to their profile. <p>
<p>Our team members: Christian Nikolopoulos, Jenieri Cyrus, Spencer Johnson.<p>
